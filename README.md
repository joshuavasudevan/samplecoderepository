This repository contains few of the codes used by me during my master's and PhD days.
There are three folders.
 1. Matlab Code - This folder contains the code developed my myself for my Master's Research "Predicting thermal comfort using thermal imaging technology". The code allows to upload thermal images and extract the skin temperature from the color bar and uses the algorithm to calculate the average skin temperature and finally outputs the relative thermal comfort.
