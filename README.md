# samplecoderepository
This repository contains few of the codes used by me during my master's and PhD days.
The PhD codes will have some missing elements as i have to remove it due to IP problems. My PhD is sponsored by Mitsubishi Electric R&D.

There are three folders.

 1. Matlab Code - This folder contains the code developed by me for my Master's Research "Predicting thermal comfort using thermal imaging technology". The code allows to upload thermal images and extract the skin temperature from the color bar and uses the algorithm to calculate the average skin temperature and finally outputs the relative thermal comfort.
 
 2. Python Code - This folder contains the code developed by me during my PhD Research "Data-driven prediction of spatially distributed parameters and control of thermal comfort and indoor air quality in offices". During my PhD i worked with IoT devices, Niagara 4 BMS framework therefore i used mqtt protocol for communication of data to the Niagara 4 system and zigbee interface to upload the data to mysql and api to retrieve the data. The folder contains all the python codes i used for mqtt protocol, data cleaning, preprocessing, machine learning model creation and control execution.

3. React JS code - This folder contains a single react js code. This is a feedback webapp which i tried to create when i was learning js during my freetime. It still needs improvement which i will work on whenever i get time.
